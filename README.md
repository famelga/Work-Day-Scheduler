## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://famelga.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

This calendar application follows the 9-5 work schedule, and allows the user to add events. The application is also color-coded based on current hour. 

Most of the html was completed, with the exception of 12pm-5pm. Using the same formatting as the previous time-blocks, I added code to create the missing hours. While the scheduler displays the hours in a 12-hour format, the div ids were labeled using the format of a 24-clock. I did this so that I could use less than, greater than, and equal to in the if/else conditional statements that were used to assign color to the textarea boxes. I also had to remove the "past", "present", "future" classes from the parent div tags so that it would not override JQuery.

I used the for each function instead of a for loop because the for each iterates through every section and passes a callback function. With the time-block class, the function added either a past, present, or future class based on the relationship between the 24-clock div ids and current hour, which was pulled from dayjs. 

Additionally, I was able to pull the current date using dayjs format, and using the text property to display the date from JavaScript to the HTML.

## Portfolio Example

Below, my setinterval function was not displaying the timer since the "i" in interval was not capitalized. JavaScript was unable to recognize it with a lowercase letter, thus my code was not communicating with each other.


```function gatherCrit() {
timerId = setinterval(countDown, 1000);
```

Here, the function is formatted correctly with a capitalized "i"  in setInterval.

```
timerId = setInterval(countDown, 1000);
```

## Learning Points 

The script.js was written using JQuery. 

By creating this application, I have learned the importance of pseudocoding. Although I experienced some struggles and did not complete the assignment, navigating the code that I completed was easier due to pseudocode. 

I was also reminded of the importance of details and specificity. There were a couple of instances in which my code was not working when I would view the page in a browser. These ended up being sue to s missing character, capitalization, or wrong formatting.
